The goal of this project is to take a video of someone using an erg (rowing machine) and extact useful information about their form using computer vision. A key part of this work will likely be [OpenPose](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose) which is a very robust system for detecting human keyoints. There is currently no code but I have included the json results of running openpose on a random [rowing youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRlXnpSNf3A) in the data folder. [This page](https://github.com/CMU-Perceptual-Computing-Lab/openpose/blob/master/doc/output.md) explains the format of the data. Additionally, there's a short example video in visualiztions. Hopefully I'll be able to write some scripts to process this data soon.
